# Ksed

Rust program that I used for creating a personalized and optimized keyboard layout for myself. The layout is optimized for typing finnish and english as well as coding. This program is intended to be used only once so it is poorly documented.

# Results

The layout I created using this program is the following:

```
Primary layer:

q j h ä ,    . m r d x
a i o e y    v t l s n
z b p u f    w k c g ;

Special characters layer:

å ] } ) ^    $ * ` ~ ´
ö [ { ( 1    2 / = - '
¨ \ # & @    % ! | € ;
where:
1 = ->
2 = =>

Number layer:

_ _ _ _ _    _ _ _ _ _
6 4 1 2 _    _ 3 1 5 7
_ _ _ 8 _    _ 9 _ _ _
```

As you can see, this layout is intended for split keyboards with multiple layers.
